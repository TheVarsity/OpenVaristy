This is the first blog post in the series I call Adventures in Crashing The Varsity with Rahul Tarak, the idea for this series and the fact that I crashed the main site twice in my first month, is actually what inspired me to make this blog.

So, what is this series? **No it is not an incident report**, it is meant to be much less format and more detailed, not focused on revealing the solution but rather my though process and every step along the way.  

I was actually planning on starting this series with reflecting on those two crashes I mentioned earlier, but yesterday night I got a ping about <https://spine.thevarsity.ca/> being broken on Chrome, so we are going to start there. This crash is not exactly my fault, but I expect most will be so this series will truly focus in my adventures in crashing The Varsity.
